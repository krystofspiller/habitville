# HabitVille

## Description

Hobby project for tracking habits and gamifying it in a tycoon-game. Create actions in line with habits you'd like to achieve for yourself, mark their completition, get rewards and spend those rewards and building your ville!

Initially started as a NextJS web app, now a monorepo including an iOS mobile app built with React Native.

## Why?

I couldn't find an app that would scratch the itch and find the right balance between the flexibility of creating whichever actions instead of choosing from a predefined list of actions and being rewarded for completing the actions and seeing those rewards turn into development of something external where, for me, as I always enjoyed tycoon games, it's developing a ville.
